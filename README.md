Oh you're really digging around huh?
Well here's where my site exists, in constant flux if you haven't noticed.
A very professional ReadMe is on my incredibly depthy To Do list for my portfolio.
Ever seen DropBox's API Documentation? I kinda want this to look like that.
Because I can definetly pull together a ReadMe before I have a full mock API Documentation Doc.
Hope you like what you see, if you don't, no sweat. It's sure to change.
Just stick around ;)
