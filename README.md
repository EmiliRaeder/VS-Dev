<h1>Oh you're really digging around huh?</h1>
<p>Well here's where my site exists, in constant flux if you haven't noticed.</p>
<p> A very professional ReadMe is on my incredibly depthy To Do list for my portfolio.</p>
<p>Ever seen DropBox's API Documentation? I kinda want this to look like that. </p>
<p>Because I can definetly pull together a ReadMe before I have a full mock API Documentation Doc.</p>
<p>Hope you like what you see, if you don't, no sweat. It's sure to change.</p>
<p>Just stick around ;)</p>
